pong - ENCE260 Embedded Programming Assignment
==============================================
pong is a two-player game using two UCFK4 microcontroller boards.


Requirements
------------
In order to build pong you need the UCFK4 drivers and modules:
    
	git clone https://eng-git.canterbury.ac.nz/rmc84/ence260-ucfk4

Clone this repository in ence260-ucfk4/assignment:

    cd path/to/ence260-ucfk4/assignment
	git clone https://eng-git.canterbury.ac.nz/ence260-2023/group_319


Installation
------------
Edit Makefile as necessary (program files will be created in the
current working directory group_319).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and run pong (if
necessary as root):

    make program

To prevent errors, reset the UCFK4 between builds and runs.
 	

Running pong
------------
The objective of the game is to win the determined number of rounds
of pong. Players win a round if the opponent fails to intercept the 
ball with their paddle.

Initially there will be starting text. Press the pushbutton BUTTON1
to proceed to round selection.

In round selection, use the navswitch NAVSWITCH_NORTH, NAVSWITCH_SOUTH,
and NAVSWITCH_PUSH to respectively increase, decrease, and set the
number of rounds to be played.

In game, use the navswitch NAVSWITCH_NORTH, NAVSWITCH_SOUTH, and
NAVSWITCH_PUSH to move and serve with the paddle.

At each rounds conclusion, the players' score will briefly display.

At the games conclusion, the result of the game will be displayed.
